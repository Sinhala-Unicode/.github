# Sinhala Unicode Tools

Here, all the various utilities I have developed for the Sinhala language are provided as open source. Most of the UCSC sources have been used to develop these applications, and the copyrights to the fonts in these applications belong to their original owners.

In addition to these projects, I have also attached the best quality projects created for the Sinhala language on Github.
